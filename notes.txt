use the /src/presentation/apps/chat/ directory to create the appropriate files for push protocol to be used in our chat app.

we want full functionality. we want our 

hooks
services
store
constants
types
utils

to be ready and composable to implement as the logic in visual UI compoenents

use //comments to label the specific functionality code you write

i will be giving you one document page at a time.

focus only on what this documents page gives you for now. 
we don't need to create EVERYTHING in one go, we're going to be very thorough here. 
create operability with every API on the page
focus on what the API docs tell you.
you have old training data on Push that is not accurate. YOU NEED THE DOCS

userService.ts - For user initialization and profile management
chatService.ts - For direct messaging and chat requests
groupService.ts - For group chat functionality
notificationService.ts - For notification handling
channelService.ts - For channel management
spaceService.ts - For space functionality
streamService.ts - For stream handling

./constants/push.ts
./types/push.ts
./services/pushService.ts
./utils/pushUtils.ts
./hooks/usePushUser.ts
./store/pushStore.ts

be thorough! update all the files needed!
actually look at what is in the pushservice and directly translate it. it is good code.

actually apply the code changes as needed please!
