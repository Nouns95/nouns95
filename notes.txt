use the /src/presentation/apps/chat/ directory

we are creating a new chat app inside of our Windows 95 in the browser Next.js app.

we are working on the visual components.
we use moudules.css for the styles.

the parent app is Chat.tsx.
the tab components live in the /src/presentation/apps/Chat/components/ directory.
our hooks live in the /src/presentation/apps/Chat/hooks/ directory.

we are using Push Protocol for the functionality.

Push enables:
- direct instant messages
- group chats
- video calls
- social audio spaces
- channels
- notifications

the parent app initializes the user and connects the stream to the Push Protocol
the features use the features hooks to implement the functionality.

think less about styling right now. we need to actually implement the functionality.

do not create unneeded complexity.

use brief //comments to label the specific functionality code you write with section headers.

actually apply the code changes as needed please!
